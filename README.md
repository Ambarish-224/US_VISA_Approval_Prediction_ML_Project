# US VISA Approval Prediction ML Project

## Problem statement.

* OFLC gives job certification applications for employers seeking to bring foreign workers into the United States and grants certifications. 
* As In last year the count of employees were huge so OFLC needs Machine learning models to shortlist visa applicants based on their previous data.

**In this project we are going to use the data given to build a Classification model:**

* This model is to check if Visa get approved or not based on the given dataset.
* This can be used to Recommend a suitable profile for the applicants for whom the visa should be certified or denied based on the certain criteria which influences the decision.
